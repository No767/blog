This space serves posts and entries that pertain to discord.py.
These have been contributed by the discord.py community and serve to
pass on the best practices and knowledge to others as well.

Note that these are heavily opinionated and influenced by the discord.py
community themselves. These tend to fork from those influences and branch off
to what I would consider best practices
